Programming Sketchbook This is a collection of P5js sketches. Just like with a normal sketchbook, the idea is that you work out a variety of different ideas in code and present them as a collection. HTML/CSS The other main languages, other than JS, used on the web are HTML and CSS. HTML is used to define the content while CSS is used for the visual output. Canvas A canvas is an HTML element that is intended for drawing graphics in web pages. Although it can produce other kinds of output, such as sound, P5js mostly uses the canvas element for its visual output. Processing P5js is a translation of an older creative coding environment called processing into JS.  Code written in Processing looks similar to code written in P5js and most of the functions are named the same."},{"location":"week1/#understanding-the-sketch","title":"Understanding the Sketch","text":"<p>There are two function declarations for the 'skeleton' program: the setup() and the draw().</p>"},{"location":"week1/#the-setup","title":"The setup()","text":"<ul> <li>The setup() function is called once by P5Js when the sketch first loads.</li> <li>this creates the canvas</li> </ul> <pre><code>function setup() {\n  createCanvas(400, 400);\n}\n\nfunction draw() {\n  background(220);\n}\n</code></pre>"}]}
